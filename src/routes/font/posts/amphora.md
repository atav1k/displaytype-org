sentence: Money is a way of measuring wealth but is not wealth in itself.
headline: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are
paragraph: It is not going to be at all easy to explain this to the world at large, because mankind has existed for perhaps one million years with relative material scarcity, and it is now roughly a mere one hundred years since the beginning of the industrial revolution. As it was once very difficult to persuade people that the earth is round and that it is in orbit around the sun, or to make it clear that the universe exists in a curved space-time continuum, it may be just as hard to get it through to “common sense” that the virtues of making and saving money are obsolete.

Amphora is a humanist blunt serif that looks a lot how it sounds. It's still a serif but much more reserved than Alegreya at a wider kerning. It's a prerelease and so variants and glyphs are limited but it's out there, the product of Calvin Anugerah Wijaya's one month internship at Tokotype in Jakarta.
